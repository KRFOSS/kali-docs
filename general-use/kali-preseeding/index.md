Being based off of Debian, Kali is able to utilize [preseed files](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed). To help explain the ways that these files can be used, and to provide usable preseed files, we have created a [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/recipes/kali-preseed-examples) that contains these example preseed files and explains how to modify them.
