Here you can check if there's a kernel available for your device, downloand, and flash it. If your device doesn't support runtime flashing, you can use the same zip in recovery. Credits to [HuskyDG](https://github.com/HuskyDG) for making this possible with [magic-flash](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/magic-flash).
